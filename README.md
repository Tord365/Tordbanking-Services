# Tordbanking Services 
Tordbanking Services is a Java-based simulation of a  basic banking system. It mimics the core operations of a real account setup through a menu-driven interface.
While Some features are simplified for simulation purposes,the structure is designed to reflect how actual banking logic works behind the scenes.
